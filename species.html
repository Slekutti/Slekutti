          <h1>Sex & Gender</h1>
          <p>Adult Slekutti often appear to either have breasts or none, but at birth or creation, they are genderless. They can create either male or female genitalia of the humanoid variety, or sometimes have both. The concept of "gender" is foreign to the Slekutti, as is "biological sex," since they were created for the sole purpose of war. As a result, Asmodeus did not deem it necessary to impose any distinctions for the Slekutti in this regard. In modern times, adult Slekutti can be described as non-binary or genderfluid, with some preferring more masculine or feminine features. However, there is little emphasis on gender distinctions within Slekutti society, as they have the ability to morph their genitalia at will, making such labels largely irrelevant.</p>

          <h1>Sex & Gender</h1>
          <p>When the Slekutti yearn to start and grow a family, they do not create children through sexual means, as they were not originally designed for child-rearing like other species. Their initial purpose was to serve as elite soldiers for Asmodeus and Mammon during the infernal civil wars. Thus, the Slekutti were not meant to long for peaceful family life and child-rearing. However, when peace was achieved and their original purpose came to an end, the surviving Slekutti, or those born from the Progenitors, desired to experience the joys of raising children, something they often observed in other more biologically inclined hellborn.</p>
          <p>To fulfill this desire, a Progenitor Slekutti, with the aid of Asmodeus, created a method to allow for "biological" children of the Slekutti. These children are often created from fragments of adult Slekutti. For example, a polycule partner might donate a fourth of their bladed material to create a single child. The most common part to donate is the legs, as they are already exposed and easy to remove. However, in cases where the legs are not in good condition due to injury or other reasons, invasive surgery is performed to obtain usable bone pieces infused with Silversteel. The ribs are the most common bones donated.</p>
          <p>Blood is also required on a monthly basis to soak into the ore containing the child's embryo. Once the child is ready to be born, after careful assessment by medical professionals, the ore is ground away until the child can be safely extracted. The entire process takes about 4 to 6 months, though it can be longer and more complicated for crossbreeds. Most family units can only have one child per birth, as the materials and the instability of the process make twins, triplets, and other multiples extremely rare. Grandparents often contribute blade material to increase the chances of multiple children, but this typically results in the child having mutations or a resurgence of Progenitor traits, colloquially known as "Beastly" traits.</p>
